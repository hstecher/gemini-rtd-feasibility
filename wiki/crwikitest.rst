               -  Attend the 9:30 coordination meeting
               -  Be the primary point of contact for software problems
                  during their shift (daytime and nighttime), requesting
                  help from other people in the group as needed.
               -  Whenever following up on a new issue (not yet
                  documented in the wiki) that has the potential to
                  recur, the software engineer performing the
                  investigation is responsible for adding the details to
                  the Wiki. There should be a troubleshooting section
                  for each system we have (see the wiki guidelines
                  here).
               -  At the end of his/her shift, the software coordinator
                  will write a brief summary, detailing outstanding
                  issues and interesting problems encountered. The
                  report will be included in the Software Operations
                  Meeting notes.

                  Fault reports
                  :name: edit-fault-reports

               -  Faults should be assigned prior too, or during the
                  9:30 meeting.
               -  The Software Coordinator is responsible for followup
                  on all FRs during their shift. They can offload to the
                  rest of the team at need.
               -  Software related faults are assigned to the individual
                  investigating the FR.
               -  Keep track of the pending fault report and make sure
                  other people update the fault reports assigned to
                  them.
               -  Create Jira REL tasks for fault reports closed as long
                  term fix (LTF). The REL task should have a reference
                  to the fault report URL in a comment if only one
                  instance, or to the master fault if there are
                  duplicates.

                  -  Add the URL to the LTF REL task in the solution
                     field when closing the fault.
                  -  The reference to the FR in the REL task should be
                     entered in *Requirement ID* field.

                  Change Requests
                  :name: edit-change-requests

               -  Check for new change software-related requests and
                  take care of them (daily). The default assignee will
                  be the software coordinator unless the CR was
                  submitted by someone in the SWG.
               -  Follow up on CR reports assigned to other people in
                  the group and make sure they take care of them.
               -  Seek approval for CR that has the potential to hold up
                  operations or other tasks.

                  -  At GS, we use a `spreadsheet in Google

               -  **Make sure that any unassigned software fault reports
                  are assigned to someone in the group**.
               -  **Make sure that any Jira tasks associated to fault
                  reports closed as long term fix during the week are
