Project Report Summary
======================

The A&G upgrade progress was consistent throughout August with drafts of
all documentation delivered ahead of schedule. All code migration and
documentation milestones are on track.

Technical Status
----------------

**Code Migration --** Status unchanged since July. The focus for the
team is to finish the documentation. A code review will be finished in
September before the lab testing begins. There’s an issue tracking

      Gemini South. These will be finalized by September 6th.

Highlights
==========

-  All documentation products finalized or drafts released for review.

-  New OIWFS Gateway documents released for Gemini South.

Lowlights (what did not go according to plan)
=============================================

-  PMAC hardware in the Gemini North lab is not currently loading
      properly. This will need to be resolved before the lab testing can
      begin in October.

Activities for the coming month(s):
===================================

-  Finalize Use cases and Requirements documents.

-  Finalize lab readiness at both sites and resolve PMAC configuration
      issues.

-  Finalize code review for migrated systems.

-  Begin executing test plans relevant for the lab environment

**Issue/Risk**                                                                               **Risk Level**            **Mitigation**
============================================================================================
=========================
========================================================================================================================
Lab hardware for HBF is possible issue. We’re confirming 2 spare PMAC boards are functional. Low due to remaining time \* Working with Stan to confirm viable spares. Stan has more PMAC spares in stock which we can ask him to borrow.
                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                       \* We may defer any testing at HBF that requires the PMAC and progress straight to the summit to complete the test plan.
